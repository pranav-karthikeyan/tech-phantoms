# Tech-phantoms Intel AI Hackathon Prototype
# Project Title: Emotion Detection in Facial Images

## Idea:
Our project aims to develop a deep learning model for emotion detection in facial images. By leveraging state-of-the-art image classification techniques, we intend to accurately classify emotions depicted in facial images into predefined categories.

## Purpose:
The purpose of our project is to provide a tool that can analyze facial expressions and infer the corresponding emotions. This technology can be applied in various domains such as market research, healthcare, and human-computer interaction. For instance, it can help companies understand customer sentiments towards their products or services, assist therapists in assessing emotional states of patients, and enhance user experience in interactive systems.

## Benefits:
- **Enhanced Decision Making:** Businesses can make data-driven decisions by understanding customer emotions and preferences.
- **Improved Healthcare:** Therapists can utilize the tool to monitor patients' emotional well-being and provide timely interventions.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Applications can personalize user experiences based on detected emotions, leading to higher user engagement and satisfaction.

## Equipment Used:
- **Model:** We used a pre-trained deep learning model for image classification, specifically "dima806/facial_emotions_image_detection".
- **Programming Language:** Python was used for coding the project.
- **Libraries:** We utilized the Transformers library from Hugging Face for model loading and inference, along with other standard libraries such as PyTorch and torchvision.
- **Data:** The model was trained on a dataset consisting of facial images labeled with corresponding emotions.

## Sources:
- **Model:** The deep learning model used in this project was obtained from the Hugging Face model hub (https://huggingface.co/dima806/facial_emotions_image_detection).
- **Data:** The training data for the model was sourced from publicly available datasets such as the FER2013 dataset.
- **Libraries:** We referred to the official documentation and resources provided by the Transformers library and PyTorch community for implementation guidance.
